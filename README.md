# node-red-jupyter-tools
Tools to manage and communicate with Jupyter servers. Allows the execution of python scripts from Node-Red on a persistent session, with data I/O.

Note: The main idea was to export some subflows as a package, but that turned out to be quite complex. So, I am sharing with you a complete flow that is an example of how to get things done using the provided subflows.

It is also available in the Node-Red library: https://flows.nodered.org/flow/35d7143ff6b0c96becfbcbd6b525c4b3

I will keep this repo active in case I ever finish exporting the subflows as a node package.
